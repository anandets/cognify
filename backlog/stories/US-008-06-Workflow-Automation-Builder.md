**Story ID**: US-008-06  
**Epic**: [EP-008 AI Automations](../epics/EP-008-AI-Automations.md)  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Not Started  

## User Story

**As an** Educational Institution Administrator  
**I want** to create custom "If X, then Y" workflow automations using a visual builder  
**So that** I can automate complex business processes without technical programming knowledge

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1**: Visual drag-drop workflow builder with condition and action blocks
- [ ] **AC2**: Pre-built triggers for common educational events and scenarios
- [ ] **AC3**: Multi-step workflow creation with conditional branching
- [ ] **AC4**: Integration with all platform modules for triggers and actions
- [ ] **AC5**: Workflow testing and simulation capabilities
- [ ] **AC6**: Error handling and retry mechanisms for failed automations
- [ ] **AC7**: Workflow performance monitoring and optimization suggestions
- [ ] **AC8**: Template library for common educational workflow patterns

## Business Value

- Automate repetitive business processes and reduce manual work by 70%
- Ensure consistent execution of institutional policies and procedures
- Improve response times for student and staff interactions
- Enable complex business logic without technical development

## Technical Requirements
