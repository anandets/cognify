**Story ID**: US-008-09  
**Epic**: [EP-008 AI Automations](../epics/EP-008-AI-Automations.md)  
**Story Points**: 5  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Not Started  

## User Story

**As a** Platform User  
**I want** to interact with the system using natural language queries and commands  
**So that** I can access information and perform tasks without learning complex interfaces

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1**: Natural language query understanding for data retrieval
- [ ] **AC2**: Voice command processing for hands-free operation
- [ ] **AC3**: Multi-language support for global user base
- [ ] **AC4**: Context-aware interpretation based on user role and current activity
- [ ] **AC5**: Intent recognition for complex multi-step requests
- [ ] **AC6**: Natural language report generation and data explanation
- [ ] **AC7**: Conversational interface for complex system configuration
- [ ] **AC8**: Learning user language patterns for improved accuracy

## Business Value
