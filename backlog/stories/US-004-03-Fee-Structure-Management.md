2. Sets up student categories with different pricing
3. Configures early bird discount with date range
4. Adds installment payment options
5. Submits for approval workflow
6. Fee structure activated and available for enrollment
7. Student enrolls and fees calculated correctly

### Edge Cases
1. Fee structure with overlapping discount periods
2. Student eligible for multiple discount categories
3. Fee calculation with multiple currency support
4. Partial payment allocation across fee categories
5. Fee structure change affecting enrolled students

### Error Scenarios
1. Invalid fee structure configuration
2. Discount percentage exceeding limits
3. Payment schedule conflicts
4. Approval workflow failure
5. Fee calculation service unavailable
