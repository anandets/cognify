## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature implemented according to acceptance criteria
- [ ] Unit tests written with 90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests for file upload functionality
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] Performance testing completed
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] User documentation created
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed

## Dependencies

- **Media Storage Service**: Required for file uploads and storage
- **Content Delivery Network**: For efficient content delivery
- **Rich Text Editor**: Third-party component for text editing
- **File Processing Service**: For file validation and processing

## Business Rules

- **Content Limits**: Maximum 100 lessons per course
- **File Size Limits**: 500MB per file, 10GB total per course
- **Naming Conventions**: Course names must be unique per instructor
- **Publication Rules**: Courses must have at least one module to be published
- **Access Control**: Only course instructors can edit course content

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. Teacher logs in and navigates to course creation
2. Creates new course with title and description
3. Adds module with multiple lessons
4. Uploads video content to lesson
5. Adds text content with formatting
6. Previews course content
7. Publishes course successfully

### Edge Cases
1. Upload file exceeding size limit
2. Upload unsupported file format
3. Create course with special characters in title
4. Drag-and-drop with unstable internet connection
5. Attempt to publish empty course

### Error Scenarios
1. Network failure during file upload
2. Storage service unavailable
3. Insufficient permissions
4. Browser compatibility issues

## Mockups and Designs

- **Course Creation Interface**: Drag-and-drop course builder
- **Content Upload Modal**: File upload with progress indicators
- **Preview Mode**: Student view simulation
- **Version History**: Timeline view of course changes

## Success Metrics

- **Course Creation Time**: Reduce average course creation time by 60%
- **User Adoption**: 80% of teachers create at least one course within 30 days
- **Content Upload Success**: 99% successful file upload rate
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.5+ stars in user feedback

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Large file upload failures
- **Medium Risk**: Browser compatibility issues
- **Low Risk**: User interface complexity
