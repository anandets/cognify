## User Story

**As a** teacher  
**I want to** track individual student progress through courses  
**So that** I can identify students who need additional support  

## Description

Teachers need comprehensive visibility into student progress across all course activities including lesson completion, assessment performance, time spent on content, and engagement metrics. The system should provide both individual student views and class-wide analytics with automated alerts for at-risk students.

## Acceptance Criteria

  - Overall course completion percentage
  - Module-by-module progress breakdown
  - Assessment scores and trends
  - Time spent on each lesson/module
  - Last activity timestamp

- [ ] **Class Overview Dashboard**
  - Class average completion rates
  - Student ranking and performance distribution
  - Engagement metrics comparison
  - Assignment submission status
  - Attendance correlation with performance

- [ ] **Progress Tracking Metrics**
  - Lesson completion status (not started, in progress, completed)
  - Video watch time vs. total duration
  - Assignment submission dates and scores
  - Quiz attempts and improvement trends
  - Discussion forum participation

### Analytics and Insights

- [ ] Real-time analytics dashboard functional
- [ ] Automated alert system operational
- [ ] Performance trend analysis working
- [ ] Mobile-responsive progress views
- [ ] Export functionality for reports
- [ ] Privacy controls implemented
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] User testing completed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Dependencies

- **Analytics Service**: Data processing and trend analysis
- **Notification Service**: Automated alerts and reminders
- **User Activity Tracking**: Real-time activity logging
- **Reporting Engine**: Data visualization and export
- **Student Profile System**: Student information and enrollment

## Business Rules

- **Data Privacy**: FERPA compliance for student data
- **Progress Calculation**: Weighted by activity importance
- **Alert Thresholds**: Configurable by institution
- **Data Retention**: 2 years minimum for academic records
- **Access Control**: Teachers see only their students

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. Teacher accesses student progress dashboard
2. Views individual student detailed progress
3. Identifies student with declining performance
4. Receives automated alert for at-risk student
5. Exports progress report for parent meeting
6. Student views their own progress dashboard

### Edge Cases
1. Student with no activity (0% progress)
2. Student with perfect completion (100% progress)
3. Handle large class sizes (200+ students)
4. Process incomplete/interrupted activities
5. Manage historical data migration

### Error Scenarios
1. Analytics service unavailable
2. Data corruption in progress tracking
3. Network timeout during report generation
4. Invalid student enrollment data
5. Performance degradation with large datasets

## Data Model

### Progress Tracking Fields
- **Student ID**: Unique identifier
- **Course/Module ID**: Content identifier
- **Activity Type**: Lesson, assessment, assignment, discussion
- **Completion Status**: Not started, in progress, completed
- **Time Spent**: Minutes engaged with content
- **Score**: Assessment/assignment grade
- **Timestamp**: Activity date and time
- **Device/Browser**: Access method

### Analytics Calculations
- **Completion Rate**: Completed activities / Total activities
- **Average Score**: Mean of all assessment scores
- **Engagement Score**: Time spent + interaction frequency
- **Progress Velocity**: Completion rate over time
- **At-Risk Score**: Composite metric of multiple factors

## Performance Requirements

- **Dashboard Loading**: Under 3 seconds for 100 students
- **Real-time Updates**: Progress updates within 30 seconds
- **Data Processing**: Analytics calculations within 5 minutes
- **Concurrent Users**: 500+ teachers accessing simultaneously

- **Access Control**: Role-based access to progress data
- **Audit Logging**: Track all access to student records
- **Privacy Compliance**: FERPA and GDPR compliance
- **Data Anonymization**: Options for research and analytics

## Success Metrics

- **Early Intervention**: 50% reduction in student dropouts
- **Teacher Engagement**: 90% of teachers use progress tracking weekly
- **Student Outcomes**: 25% improvement in completion rates
- **Alert Effectiveness**: 80% of at-risk alerts lead to intervention
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.6+ stars for progress tracking tools
