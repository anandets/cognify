## Dependencies
- **Before**: US-002-01 (Student Profile Management), US-002-05 (Class Scheduling)
- **Integrates with**: US-002-02 (Enrollment Management), US-002-03 (Academic Records)
- **Required services**: Authentication, Notification, Scheduling

## Business Rules
1. **Attendance Marking**: Only authorized faculty can mark attendance for their assigned classes
2. **Grace Period**: Students arriving within grace period are marked as present
3. **Excuse Policies**: Excused absences don't count toward attendance percentage calculations
4. **Minimum Attendance**: Students must meet minimum attendance requirements for course completion
5. **Retroactive Changes**: Attendance changes require proper justification and approval
6. **Data Retention**: Attendance records must be retained per institutional policy
