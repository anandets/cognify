# ðŸ§  System Overview

Cognify is a multi-tenant, AI-powered SaaS platform for coaching centers, training businesses, and educational institutions (excluding Kâ€“12). It supports LMS, SIS, ERP, CRM, CMS, Marketing, Compliance, and more.

The platform will follow a microservices-first architecture, with modular service domains communicating via REST/gRPC and event-driven messaging (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) where real-time sync or decoupling is critical.

A multi-tenant monorepo + polyglot service setup ensures a balance between shared libraries, service isolation, and developer velocity.

Key architectural traits:
    Global-scale SaaS with multi-tenant architecture
    Domain-driven microservices
    API-first, with clear GraphQL/REST gateways
    Built-in AI orchestration layer for workflows, triggers, and personalization
    Enterprise-grade RBAC, audit, and compliance
    Native support for offline-first operations (sync engines)

Architecture is modular microservices-first with GraphQL/REST APIs and async messaging (Kafka/RabbitMQ), built with security, AI integration, and regional compliance in mind.
