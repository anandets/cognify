## Prommpt for dev project at power.
Kindly go through the entire repo and ceate a complete development plan in a separate md file in root folder named  │
│   powercoderplan.md . Fetch all tasks from dev-project.md and Readme.md as well and organize all the development      │
│   task sequentially one by in in different categories within various tables that you want to segregate. You can       │
│   create different tables for different grouped tasks. Make sure you do mention in each table- Task Name, Stories     │
│   linked to, Backend or Frontend Task, Integrations if required, QA or Testing Status, and anythin gelse yuou deem    │
│   fit to be added. Please make this table according to the best developer knowledge you have and having gone through  │
│   all the Epics, Stories. Also make sure you link each task to the UI_SCREENS in docs also as you have to build ui    │
│   screens in development. Some tasks might not require UI_Screen reference and we can let that go. There are some     │
│   missing files in UI_SCREEN for the pending stories. Right now you can just refer those files in the original story  │
│   or add Missin_UI_Story_US-10-02 e.g.     This plan file shall act as your guiding mantra and work to be done.    │
│   Once one task is done you will move on to the next and keep updating this file only. Once this file is updated,     │
│   all relevant files such as Readme.md and dev-project.md can be updated.
